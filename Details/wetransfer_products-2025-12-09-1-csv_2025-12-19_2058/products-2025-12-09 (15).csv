The compressor can either be attached the rear of the refrigerator - as shown in the picture - or placed to the side or above the unit to suit your needs (the compressor is attached with 1.5m flexible pipe). As it stands, the fridge will run off a 12 or 24 volt supply, but can also run on 230v mains when connected to a MPS35 mains adapter.</p> <p>The unit has a 39 litre capacity including 5.3-litre freezer compartment situated at the top of the fridge. Like many compressor fridges, you can run the CRP40 off a single solar panel, which makes them ideal for camper vans and narrow boats where you may be without power for a few days.</p> <ul> <li><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><a href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/caravan/motorhome/dometic/waeco/crx/fridge/standard/frame/"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><strong>Standard frame</strong></span></a></span></li> <li><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><a href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/caravan/motorhome/dometic/waeco/crx/fridge/flush/frame/"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><strong>Flush frame</strong></span></a></span></li> </ul> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" title=""crp40-dimensions.jpg"" src=""https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-fkhd5nhp/product_images/uploaded_images/crp40-dimensions.jpg"" alt=""crp40-dimensions.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""301"" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",849.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.1000,38.0000,53.6000,54.5000,N,N,"# Discontinued","by product",0,0,"Fridges & Coolboxes/Fridges;Fridges & Coolboxes/Fridges/Compressor;Fridges & Coolboxes;Fridges & Coolboxes/Fridges/Compressor/Under Counter (Max height 821mm)",242,k/869/crp40_open__27563.jpg,"Dometic Waeco Coolmatic CRP40 showing open freezer box",Y,0,239,n/649/crp40__24803.jpg,"Dometic Waeco Coolmatic CRP40 Compressor Refrigerator",N,1,243,q/820/crp40_side__61877.jpg,"Dometic Waeco Coolmatic CRP40 with the remote mountable Danfos compressor attached at the rear, as it comes to you!",N,2,241,e/010/crp40_flushframes__71754.jpg,"Dometic Waeco Coolmatic CRP40 Optional Flush Frame",N,3,244,x/128/crp40_standfrme__41048.jpg,"Dometic Waeco Coolmatic CRP40 Optional Standard Frame",N,4,240,i/147/crp40_dims__42324.jpg,"Dometic Waeco Coolmatic CRP40 Dimensions",N,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"crp40, refrigerator, fridge, 9105600001, 40, crp 40, ","Dometic Waeco CRP40 Caravan & Motorhome 2-Way Compressor Fridge","dometic waeco, coolmatic, crp40, refrigerator, fridge, caravan, motorhome, boat, marine","The CRP40 by Dometic Waeco Coolmatic is a small 2 way boat fridge which has a removable compressor",,,,New,N,N,,N,,,0,"Default Tax Class",5999024861160,N,/caravan/motorhome/dometic/waeco/crp40/compressor/fridge/,,5999024861160,9105204440,,"""Height (mm)=536"";""Width (mm)=380"";""Depth (mm)=545"";""Cabinet Depth (Without cooling unit)=370"";Operation=Compressor;""Approx Weight=18kg"";""Runs on=12/24v DC"";""Capacity=39 litres including 5.3-litre freezer compartment"";Connections=12/24v;""Average power consumption=approx. 40 watts"";""Current consumption=0.77 Ah/h at +25°C ambient temperature, 1.17 Ah/h at +32°C ambient temperature, both at +5°C interior temperature"";""More Information=Call us on 0151 334 0222"";fbt-product=/dometic/waeco/mps35/mains/adaptor/"

Product,236,"Fiamma F45S Campervan and Motorhome Wall Mount Awning",P,F45s,,Fiamma,"F45 Awning",Right,"<h1>Fiamma F45S Campervan and Motorhome Wall Mount Awning</h1> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The very latest, strongest and much improved version of the well known Fiamma F45 wind out awnings for Motorhomes and Camper vans. Smooth and silent when winding in and out, even silent when travelling, due to the aerodynamic end caps, which are now made in &lsquo;tree resistant&rsquo; aluminium!</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Fiamma F45S awning comes in a range of sizes from 1.9 metres to 4.5 metres to suit Campervans, Motorhomes and even Work Vans. The fully waterproof and washable canopy is readily available in Royal Grey and Royal Blue. The front wind out aluminium bar uniquely has two guide grooves to allow the fitting of two different accessories at the same time. The legs which are stored within the front bar, can stand upon the ground, or can be clipped to the motorhomes sidewall. A crank handle is included with the F45S awning. A range of awning extras include a wind and rain blocker front and side panels or a full Privacy Room which allows you to turn this canopy into a full awning for longer stays.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Available Accessories</h2> <p>Our range of add-ons will enhance your camping experience and make your time on the road even more enjoyable.</p> <ul> <li>Awning lights: Illuminate your camping area with our bright and energy-efficient LED lights. Perfect for evening gatherings and late-night chats.</li> <li>Side panels: Expand your living space with our durable and waterproof side panels. Keep the bugs out and the comfort in!</li> <li>Groundsheets: Protect your awning from the ground up with our custom-fit groundsheets. Made from heavy-duty materials, they will keep you dry and comfortable.</li> </ul> <h2>Awning Brackets</h2> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Fiamma F45s awning brackets are specific mounting brackets designed to securely attach the Fiamma F45s awning to a campervan or motorhome. These brackets are vehicle-specific, meaning that there are different brackets for different types of vehicles, and it's important to choose the correct bracket for your vehicle to ensure proper installation and function of the awning.<br /><br />The brackets are made from high-quality materials, to ensure durability and long-lasting performance. They are designed to hold the Fiamma F45s awning in place and distribute the weight evenly, preventing any damage to the vehicle or the awning itself.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">The Fiamma F45s awning brackets play an essential role in ensuring that the awning operates effectively and safely on your campervan and motorhome.</h3> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" style=""display: block;

Product,320,"Solar Pods Swimming Pool Heater",P,POD001,,,,Right,"<h2>Swimming Pool Solar Heating Pod</h2> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Compatible for use with either in ground or above ground pools, our <strong>Swimming Pool Solar Pods</strong> are a space, eco and energy efficient method for providing expandable heating to your swimming pool.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Every watt of swimming pool solar heating is sourced from the suns natural energy, making this free source of energy an exceptionally cost effective addition to an existing heating system. Featuring a strong transparent polycarbonate dome that reduces heat loss from the wind, these Swimming Pool Solar Pods retain heat incredibly well and can also be tilted in order to harness the best angle for sunshine.</p> <p><strong><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=""false"" LatentStyleCount=""156"">  </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0cm; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-ansi-language:#0400; 	mso-fareast-language:#0400; 	mso-bidi-language:#0400;} </style> <![endif]--><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""eco-pool-solar-pod-main.jpg"" src=""https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-fkhd5nhp/product_images/uploaded_images/eco-pool-solar-pod-main.jpg"" alt=""eco-pool-solar-pod-main.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></strong></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Incredibly low maintenance, Solar Heating Pods require no servicing apart from Winterising, and also benefit from being superbly easy to install, simply requiring a Philips screwdriver and silicon lubricant to carry out the installation. Set them up on a roof in close proximity to the pool, or even next to the pool itself; at only 580 x 580mm, Swimming Pool Solar Pods take up very little space, and as such are ideal for when you don&rsquo;t have a lot of room to spare!&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Each pod is designed to heat 4500 litres but can be easily scaled up for larger pools with additional pods. We recommend that customers phone for advice on solar pods, as there&rsquo;s quite a few considerations to bear in mind regarding the quantity of solar pods required for your specific pool size as well as positioning of the solar pods (i.e. installation on roofs or in positions away from the filtration system can require more powerful pumps).
