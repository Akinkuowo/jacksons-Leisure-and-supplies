As a result, the <em>Waeco CRX50 Compressor Fridge</em> can be used as a conventional fridge/freezer, full fridge or full freezer. The Waeco CRX50 also now features a slightly chamfered rear wall, this helps clear the strengthening pieces found in many vans at floor level, and also helps for a 'snug' fit in marine applications where the hull turns inwards near the bilges.</p> <h3>Dometic Waeco Compressor fridge CRX50 the features:</h3> <ul> <li>New soft touch control panel</li> <li>Intelligent electronic control of the compressor speed - up to 25% less energy consumption</li> <li>5 different temperature settings</li> <li>2 stage battery protection</li> <li>Chamfered cabinet at rear base to help clear the campervan or caravan side</li> <li>Bright led interior light with infrared sensor</li> <li>Large bottle holder</li> <li>Door tray</li> <li>Salad bin</li> <li>2 years warranty</li> </ul> <h3>Versatile and engineered for ease of use and continual high performance for your campervan or boat</h3> <p>The door of the <em>Waeco CRX50 2-Way Compressor Fridge</em> can be hinged on either side to conveniently accommodate for a left or right opening, whilst the&nbsp;d&eacute;cor panel can also be replaced to suit the interior of your campervan. The <em>Waeco CRX50 Compressor 2-Way Fridge</em> also features a venting position in the door lock to maintain freshness and airflow when the fridge isn't in use and a double locking mechanism so the door can be secured at the top and bottom.</p> <h3>Alternative fridge models</h3> <table class=""table table-striped"" style=""height: 182px; width: 553px;""> <tbody> <tr> <td>Fridge</td> <td>Height</td> <td>Width</td> <td>Depth</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a title=""Dometic CRX50 12v camper fridge"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/dometic/waeco/crx50/fridge/"" target=""_blank""><span>Dometic CRX50 Compressor Fridge</span></a></td> <td>534mm</td> <td>&nbsp;380mm</td> <td>&nbsp;500mm</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a title=""Dometic CRE50 12v camper fridge"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/dometic/cre50/12volt/campervan/fridge/"" target=""_blank""><span>Dometic CRE50 Compressor Fridge</span></a></td> <td>534mm</td> <td>&nbsp;380mm</td> <td>&nbsp;500mm</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a title=""Webastor CR49 12V Camper fridge"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/webasto/cruise/cr49/elegance/campervan/caravan/marine/fridge/""><span>Webasto CR49 Compressor Fridge</span></a></td> <td>520mm</td> <td>&nbsp;381mm</td> <td>&nbsp;500mm</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a title=""Vitrifrigo C51i Compressor Fridge"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/caravan-motorhome/vitrifrigo-c51i-12-24v-caravan-marine-compressor-fridge/"" target=""_blank""><span>Vitrifrigo C51i Compressor fridge</span></a></td> <td>532mm</td> <td>&nbsp;380mm</td> <td>&nbsp;459mm (Flush 501mm)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3><br />Manual:</h3> <p><a href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/dometic/DometicCRX50-65-80-110-140Install_operation_manaual.pdf"" target=""_blank""><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""download-manual.jpg"" src=""https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-fkhd5nhp/product_images/uploaded_images/download-manual.jpg"" alt=""download-manual.jpg"" width=""202"" height=""73"" /></a></p> <h2>Diagnostics</h2> <ul> <li><a title=""CRX Flashes"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/dometic/CR50%20Flashes%20Chart.jpg"" target=""_blank"">CR/CRX Flashes Chart</a></li> <li><a title=""Danfoss Diagnostics"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/dometic/Danfoss%20Diagnostics.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Danfoss Compressor Diagnostics</a></li> <li><a title=""Coolmatic Troubleshooter"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/dometic/coolmatic-cr-troubleshooter.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Coolmatic CR Troubleshooter</a></li> </ul>",479.00,390.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,"2 year Service Centre Warranty",0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,N,Y,,"by option",0,100,"Fridges & Coolboxes/Fridges;Fridges & Coolboxes/Fridges/Compressor;Fridges & Coolboxes;Fridges & Coolboxes/Fridges/Compressor/Under Counter (Max height 821mm)",5125,i/292/CoolMatic_CRX_50__38075.jpg,"Dometic Waeco CRX 50 campervan marine fridge",N,0,5124,h/181/CoolMatic_CRX_50_Open__57069.jpg,"Dometic Waeco CRX50 Motorhome Fridge",Y,1,5329,g/557/CRX_50__64563.jpg,"Dometic Waeco CRX50 Caravan fridge with door open",N,2,5122,l/031/CRXControlPanel__93189.jpg,"Dometic Waeco CRX Fridge control panel",N,3,5326,u/352/CRXRemovableFreezer1__23333.jpg,"Dometic Waeco CRX50 Removable freezer draw",N,4,5327,h/790/CRXRemovableFreezer__12300.jpg,"Dometic Waeco CRX50 Freezer",N,5,5328,n/944/CRX_compressor__27747.jpg,"Dometic Waeco CRX50",N,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"CRX50, marine, compressor, campervan, van, caravan, boat, horsebox, jc1301,","Dometic Waeco CRX50 Compressor Fridge Marine Campervan Refrigerator","Dometic CRX50, Dometic CRX50 fridge, marine, Waeco, CRX50, Fridge, Compressor, Boat, Campervan, motorhome, Refrigerator","Dometic Waeco CRX50 the latest very economical 12v and 24v fridge ideal for smaller leisure vehicles, campervan, marine or motorhome!",,,,New,N,N,,N,,,0,"Default Tax Class",4015704256956,N,/dometic/waeco/crx50/fridge/,,4015704256956,9105306565,,"Model=CRX50;""Refrigeration technology=Compressor"";Wheelarch=No;""Dimensions H (mm)=534"";""Dimensions W (mm)=380"";""Dimensions D (mm)=500"";""Input voltage (DC), [V]=12V"";""Rated input power (DC), [W]=-"";""Energy consumption (DC@5/25°C), [kWh/24h]=-"";""Total volume=41.2L"";""Frozen Volume Total=4.4L"";""Climate class (EN62552)=-"";""Weight (kg)=17Kg"";SKU=9105306565"

Dometic has introduced a new line of solutions, with a width of just 468 millimetres.</p> <p>The first two models to arrive in the Motorhome and Caravan after market, are:</p> <p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>The</strong></span> <span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Dometic RML 9430 with battery ignition system*</strong> </span>and the&nbsp;<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong> 9435 with automatic energy selection (AES) **</strong></span> &ndash; both with a capacity of 147 litres.</p> <h3><span style=""font-size: small; color: #000000;"">* What is the battery ignition system?</span></h3> <p><span style=""font-size: small; color: #000000;"">A: The Battery Ignition System on the RM 9430, means that it has a small unit containing a lithium battery, and you must select the power source (12v, Gas, Mains) Manually on the control panel.<br /></span></p> <h3><span style=""font-size: small; color: #ff0000;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">**What is the Automatic Energy Selection (AES) ?</span></span></h3> <p><span style=""font-size: small; color: #000000;"">A: The Automatic Energy Selection (AES) means that the motorhome fridge freezer will automatically select the power source in use, for example, switching from 240v to 12v whilst travelling, and then back to mains power when the Motorhome or Caravan has hook-up.</span></p> <p>The two pioneers of Dometic&rsquo;s latest motorhome &amp; caravan fridge freezer generation have integrated door handles (see pictures), and, despite their extremely compact outside dimensions the 9-Series motorhome &amp; caravan fridge freezer has ample capacity inside. The fridge cabinet is organised by short and long trays, drawers with partitions and bottle holders as well as four height-adjustable door racks, a removable 12-litre freezer compartment and bright LED strip lights add the usual finishing touches we have all come to expect from Dometic.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Dometic RML Motorhome &amp; Caravan Fridge Freezer Features:</h2> <ul class=""usps""> <li><span style=""font-size: small;""> Freezer compartment down to -12&deg;C</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Absolutely silent</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">1 short shelf and 2 long shelves</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">4 adjustable shelves</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Removable 12-litre freezer compartment</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Door handles in automotive design</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">LED strip light</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">With battery-powered ignition unit</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Requires Ventilation via 2 x LS300 Vents(Available seperately<br /></span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">All gas appliances must be fitted by a qualified gas engineer, failure to comply may affect your warranty.</span></span></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-size: small; color: #ff0000;""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/g3yDKbmX764?rel=0"" width=""425"" height=""350"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></span></p>",1549.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,"2 Years",50.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,N,N,"Sold Out","by option",2147483647,0,"Fridges & Coolboxes/Fridges;Fridges & Coolboxes/Fridges/Absorption;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome",5370,o/719/RML15__26736.jpg,,Y,0,5361,i/912/RML10__97795.jpg,,N,1,5347,l/304/RML4__69931.jpg,,N,2,5358,k/761/RML8__82564.jpg,,N,3,5339,o/561/RML13__14763.jpg,,N,4,5338,n/897/RML18__32469.jpg,,N,5,5359,r/418/RML7__66578.jpg,,N,6,5340,a/329/RML3__64048.jpg,,N,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dometic RML 9430/9435 Fridge Freezer 12v Gas 240v","Motorhome, fridge, campervan, gas, electric","The Dometic 9 Series Motorhome fridge is a fully fledged fridge which can be fitted into your motorhome ",,,,New,N,N,,N,,,0,"Default Tax Class",,N,/caravan-motorhome/fridges/3-way-fridges/dometic-rml-9430-9435-caravan-motorhome-fridge-freezer-3-way/,,,,,"""Dimensions=H1293 x W468 x D555 mm"";Height(mm)=1293;Width(mm)=468;Depth(mm)=555;Operation=Absorption;""Gross volume=146 Litres"";""Total Storage Volume=142 Litres"";""Fridge storage volume=130 Litres"";""Freezer Storage Volume=12 Litres"";""Energy supply=12 V DC / 230 V AC / LPG"";""Approximate wight=37.0 Kg"";""Cools to=Refrigerator +7 °C, freezer compartment up to -12 °C at ambient temperatures up to +32 °C (equivalent to climate class SN)"";""More information=Ring 0151 334 0222"""

Product,1629,"Certikin Hurricane Commercial Swimming Pool Pumps",P,Hurricane,,Certikin,"Hurricane Pump Option Set",Right,"<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Certikin Hurricane Commercial Pumps</h1> <p>The Certikin Hurricane commercial swimming pool pump range offers all the power and performance of a traditional cast iron centrifugal pump with the added versatility of a chemically resistant and is built with lightweight modern plastic in design.&nbsp;The Certikin Hurricane isn't just a pump; it's a powerhouse designed to tackle the demanding needs of large-scale commercial pools and water features. Its robust construction and high-flow performance along with unwavering reliability make it the ideal choice for hotels, resorts, aquatic centres, and any application where clear water and efficient circulation are crucial.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Certikin Hurricane pump is capable of pumping large volumes of water at high pressure, the Hurricane pumps are also supplied with 3- phase motors starting at 2.9 kW (4.0HP) through to 9.2kW (12.5HP), achieving flows in excess of 150m3/ hr.</p> <h2>Features:</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Flooded suction:</strong> Unlike traditional pumps that require water to be above a certain level to function, the Certikin Hurricane has a flooded suction design. This means it can effortlessly prime and maintain optimal performance even at lower water levels, making it ideal for pools with variable water depths or those with automatic pool covers.</li> <li><strong>Saltwater compatible:</strong> Traditional pool pumps can be easily corroded by the harsh chemicals in saltwater pools. The Certikin Hurricane, however, is built with saltwater-resistant materials, such as 316 stainless steel and bronze impellers, to withstand the corrosive nature of saltwater and provide long-lasting durability. This makes it the perfect choice for saltwater pools, spas, and other marine environments.</li> <li><strong>Pre-filter versatility:</strong> The Certikin Hurricane comes in two models: with or without a pre-filter. The pre-filter model is ideal for pools with a lot of debris, as it captures large particles before they reach the pump, protecting it from damage and extending its lifespan. The non-pre-filter model is a good option for pools with minimal debris or those that already have a separate filtration system.</li> <li><strong>Quick fit unions:</strong> Installing and maintaining a pool pump can be a time-consuming and frustrating task. The Certikin Hurricane features quick-fit union connections that make it easy to connect and disconnect the pump from the plumbing system. This saves you time and effort, and makes routine maintenance a easier and quicker.</li> </ul> <h2>Built to Last:</h2> <ul> <li><strong>316 stainless steel shaft:</strong> Resists corrosion and wear for exceptional longevity.</li> <li><strong>High-performance impellers:</strong> Choose from plastic (4.0HP and 5.5HP) or bronze (7.5HP, 10HP, and 12.5HP) impellers for optimal flow and efficiency.</li> <li><strong>Stainless steel strainer basket (pre-filter models):</strong> Captures debris and protects your pump, ensuring smooth operation.</li> <li><strong>IP55 protection:</strong> Provides exceptional resistance to dust and water ingress for enhanced safety and reliability.</li> <li><strong>Max water temperature of 40&deg;C:</strong> Suitable for a wide range of pool environments and applications.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table style=""width: 599px; height: 286px;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""10"" align=""center""> <tbody> <tr class=""tabletopcolor""> <td width=""142""> <div align=""center""><strong>Code</strong></div> </td> <td width=""233""> <div align=""center""><strong>Description</strong></div> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <div align=""center"">CP400s</div> </td> <td> <div align=""center"">4.0HP -

Product,1659,"Astral Vic Bobbin Wound Commercial Swimming Pool Sand Filter",P,,,Astral,"Astral Vic Filters",Right,"<h2>Astral Vic Commercial Bobbin Wound Swimming Pool Sand Filter</h2> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Astral Vic bobbin wound filter provides a high quality and robust filtration solution for commercial swimming pools and replaces the Atena model. Featuring a new top cover system with quick locking mechanism and a 400 x 500 mm opening. The air relief valve is fitted into the cover in order to help eliminate air from the filter.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Vic bobbin wound commercial filter is fitted with new 1 1/2"" collector arms in moulded ABS, these one piece laterals vary in length from 90mm to 525mm and replace the need for interconnecting unions previously required to make up the length. This makes maintenance easier and more effective. Less head drain loss is also achieved thanks to the increased diameter of the collector arms.<br /><br />The collector tubes are manufactured in moulded PVC and have a diameter of 90mm. Water drainage and air relief are now quicker thanks to the inclusion of 1"" diameter air and water purge valves.<br /><br />The distance between the upper sand bed and the freeboard has been increased to ensure improved water distribution in the filtration stage and to avoid sand falling into the drainage system during the wash cycle.<br /><br />These Astral Vic commercial bobbin wound swimming pool filters are suitable for filtration velocities of 20, 30 &amp; 40m&sup3;/h/m&sup2; and feature a 1.0m deep filtration bed.<br /><br />All Astral Vic filters are designed to be connected to Valve manifolds bought separately.<br /><br />If ozone is to be used an interior vinylester coating is required.</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Maximum working pressure for all Astral Vic commercial bobbin wound swimming pool filters is 2.5 Kg/cm&sup2;</strong></p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Filter vessels with 2000mm diameter may require a special transport vehicle.

These stylistic features, combined with the complementary end profiles, give the awning rail a professional look.</span></span></p> <p><span style=""font-size: small;"">You can also use the Reimo multi-rail campervan awning rail to fit a canopy or awning to the gutter by using a pole and clamps. A second channel for fitting your awning directly via a Kador strip makes it ideal for drive away awnings, too.</span></p> <h3>Reimo Campervan Awning Rail Features:</h3> <ul> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Dimensions short wheel base: 2.6 metres</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Integrated gutter system</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Compatible with roof racks</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Suitable for loads of up to 100kg</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""color: #ff0000; font-size: small;"">This kit does NOT include the sealant - we recommend Sikaflex 221</span></p>",249.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.1000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,Y,"In stock & sent on a next working day carrier!","by option",0,0,"Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome;Awnings ;Awnings /Accessories;Awnings /Campervan;Awnings /Accessories/Fixing Kits;Awnings /Accessories/Accessories",10254,i/043/reimo__12785.jpg,"Reimo Multirail camper van awning rail",Y,0,6613,p/764/Multi_Rail_5__10844.jpg,"Campervan awning rail",N,1,6614,w/479/Multi_Rail_2__99402.jpg,"Reimo Awning Multi Rail",N,2,6615,i/936/Multi_Rail_3__95354.jpg,"Canopy and drive away awning rail",N,3,6616,k/668/Multi_Rail_7__48326.jpg,,N,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"reimo, multi rail,","Reimo Multirail campervan Awning rail suitable for T4 T5 T6 van","reimo, multirail, awning rail, T5 awning rail, T6 awning Rail, awning rail, reimo rail,","Reimo multirail awing rail ideal for T4 T5 & T6 campervan awning sun canopy",,,,New,N,N,,N,,,0,"Default Tax Class",,N,/campervan/caravan/motorhome/awnings/reimo/multirail/vw/t4/t5/t6/canopy/,,,901561,,"Colour=Black;""Compatibility=Only suitable for vans with sliding door on the left"";""Kit Includes=Instructions, Fixings, Installation guide with photos"""
