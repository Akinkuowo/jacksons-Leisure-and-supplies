Product,1307,"Fiamma A20 Universal Expansion Tank for Caravan, Marine and Motorhome Water Pumps",P,02478-02-,,Fiamma,,Right,"<h1 style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"">Ensure a smooth and continuous flow of water in your caravan, boat or motorhome<span style=""font-size: small;""><br /></span></span></h1> <p>The pulsating water flow generated by pressure switched water pumps is replaced by a constant flow of water when you install a Fiamma A20 Universal Expansion Tank. Your water pump draws water from your water tank then pumps that water through the expansion tank. The internal pressurised diaphragm in the expansion tank eliminates any pulsating water flow and ensures a smooth, continuous flow instead, in the quantity required for showering or running a tap.</p> <h2>Universal use</h2> <p>The A20 is designed for universal use and is therefore an ideal addition to our <a href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/caravan-and-camping/water-plumbing/water-pumps/shurflo-trail-king-caravan-motorhome-pressurised-water-pump/"" target=""_blank"">Shurflo Trail King</a> water pumps, previous models and <strong>all other types of pressure switch pumps</strong>. The Fiamma A20 Universal Expansion Tank is small and compact, not much bigger than a 750ml bottle of water.</p> <h3>Extend the life of your pump and cut water consumption with the&nbsp;Fiamma A20 universal expansion tank&nbsp;</h3> <p>The universal expansion tank also saves on water and electricity, increasing the pump performance and prolonging the life of the pump, all for an outlay of around half the price of the pump. The tank builds up a head of water which under pressure comes out in a steady stream due to the internal pressurized diaphragm providing a smooth, surge-free continuous flow. The A20 can be dismantled for diaphragm operations if necessary.</p> <h3>Can be adapted to a multitude of pressure switch pumps</h3> <p>It is supplied with straight and angled 13mm flexible hose connectors and self-tapping screws for fitting. Precharged at 0.9 bars (13 Psi) the Fiamma A20 can be charged with its special valve by a normal compressor so it can be adapted to all pressure switch pumps that are on the market.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Installation Guide</h3> <p><a title=""Fiamma Expansion Tank A20-02478-01"" href=""https://store-fkhd5nhp.mybigcommerce.com/content/pdf/fiamma/Fiamma_98690-047_A20-02478-01-Expansion-tank.pdf"" target=""_blank""><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" title=""A20-02478-01-Expansion Tank"" src=""https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-fkhd5nhp/product_images/uploaded_images/download-pdf.jpg"" alt=""Expansion Tank Installation Manual"" width=""249"" height=""90"" /></a></p>",31.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,"24 Months",0.1000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,Y,"The Fiamma A20 Universal Expansion Tank is sent on a next working day carrier!",none,31,0,"Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Water Tanks & Plumbing;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Water Tanks & Plumbing/Water Pumps;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Water Tanks & Plumbing/Plumbing",20044,d/686/fiamma-a20-expansion-tank-black__64758.jpg,"Fiamma A20 Universal Expansion Tank for Caravan, Marine and Motorhome Water Pumps (02478-02-) 2024 Model",Y,0,3904,r/627/A20.4__53213.jpg,"Fiamma A20 Universal Expansion Pump Tank Vertical Measurements",N,1,3905,a/523/A20.3__18825.jpg,"Fiamma A20 Universal Expansion Pump Tank Horizontal Measurements",N,2,3906,g/108/A20.2__42586.jpg,"Fiamma A20 Universal Expansion Pump Tank Dual Measurements",N,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fiamma, A20, Expansion Tank, Tank, Water, Pump, Flow, 02478-01-, 02478-02-","Fiamma A20 Universal Expansion Tank for constant water flow","Fiamma, A20, Expansion Tank, Tank, Water, Pump, Flow, 02478-01-, 02478-02-","The A20 Expansion Tank ensures a pump with an extended life and cuts down on water & electricity, ",,,,New,N,N,,N,,,0,"Default Tax Class",8004815035778,N,/fiamma/caravan/water/pump/expansion/tank/,,,,,fbt-product=https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/caravan-motorhome/john-guest-12mm-straight-female-adaptor/
