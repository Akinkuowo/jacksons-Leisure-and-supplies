What's more, the tight, dense weave used in the 180D curtain fabric prevents silhouettes from being cast against your curtains too, giving you perfect privacy.</p> <h2>Improve your camper's thermal insulation</h2> <p>The dense curtain fabric also helps to insulate your windows, which are a primary source of heat loss in campervans.

We've selected these curtains for their excellent fabric quality and rich, thermally effective weave. The curtains are coated to resist fire, and also use a UV-resistant finish to ensure they don't fade in sunlight.</p> <h2>Improve your comfort - day or night</h2> <p>In daytime, these curtains use their dense weave to protect against sunlight and moderate temperatures. Equally, by night, the fabric insulates your windows (a common source of heat loss), and prevents your silhouettes being cast against the curtains by your interior lighting.</p> <h2>Robust aluminium rails</h2> <p>The curtains fit to the included lightweight aluminium rails, which are pre-curved to match the contours around the window frames in the Renault Trafic, Vauxhall Vivaro or Nissan Primastar. The curtains include rustproof brass fasteners to prevent any light leaks.</p> <h3>Campervan curtains features:</h3> <ul> <li>Dense&nbsp;150F48 detex jersey fabric</li> <li>Modern grey finish</li> <li>UV resistant fabric coating to prevent colour fade</li> <li>Fire resistant</li> <li>Pre-curved curtain rails</li> <li>Thermally insulative</li> <li>Rustproof brass fasteners</li> <li>Compatible with the Renault Trafic (2004-2014), Vauxhall Vivaro and Nissan Primastar</li> </ul> <h3>Download fitting instructions for your campervan side and tailgate curtains here:</h3> <h3><a title=""VW T5 Campervan Curtain Fitting Guide"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/campervan-curtains/Campervan-side-curtain-fitting-instructions.pdf"" target=""_blank""><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server1100/fkhd5nhp/product_images/uploaded_images/pdf-install-guide.jpg"" alt="""" width=""149"" height=""54"" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title=""VW T5 Campervan Tailgate Curtain Fitting Guide"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/campervan-curtains/Campervan-tailgate-curtain-fitting-instructions.pdf"" target=""_blank""><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server1100/fkhd5nhp/product_images/uploaded_images/pdf-install-guide.jpg"" alt="""" width=""149"" height=""54"" /></a></h3>",34.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.1000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,Y,"Fast delivery options available!",none,479,0,"Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Windows & Rooflights;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Windows & Rooflights/Curtains & Blinds;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Windows & Rooflights/Curtains & Blinds/Standard & Black Out Curtains;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Conversion Equipment/Windows/Curtains & Blinds",14563,k/278/trafic-curtain__19403.jpg,,Y,0,13796,a/228/c2814e4909.__47008.jpg,"Grey curtains kit for renault trafic or vauxhall vivaro vans",N,1,13797,h/159/62419407c5._1__35926.jpg,"Curtain fabric and brass clip fasteners",N,2,13798,j/640/6937f79087._1__86400.jpg,"Pre-curved aluminium curtain rails for campervan",N,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,curtains,"Campervan Curtains Kit for Renault Trafic / Vivaro / Primastar","curtains,trafic,vivaro,primastar,renault,rail,campervan,camper,van","Curtains kit with pre-curved rails to match Trafic, Vivaro or Primastar van window frames.

It's sourced from a trusted supplier used throughout the automotive industry, making it perfect for reliable electrical installations in caravans, campervans, motorhomes, cars and boats. Available in Black &amp; Red cable colours.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Designed for 12v/24v use</h2> <p>This cable is designed for the voltages used in your campervan, motorhome, car or boat. This means it's safe to run at 12v or 24v, with a maximum voltage of 60v. The thin wall gives this cable a reduced weight, providing considerable weight and volume savings when used in wiring harnesses. The PVC insulation is also resistant to petrol, diesel and lubricating oils, as well as abrasions and cuts.</p> <h2>Ultra durable</h2> <p>On top of the physical resistance offered by this high-grade insulation, this cable is also rated for temperature ranges of between&nbsp;<span>-40&ordm;C to 105&ordm;C, with a short term peak limit of&nbsp;<span>120&ordm;C.

(Note: GX device sold separately).</p> <h3>Key Features:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>PowerControl &amp; PowerAssist:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<em>MultiPlus</em>&nbsp;<em>II&nbsp;</em>prevents overloading of limited AC sources (generators, shore power) by strategically managing battery power and AC input. It boosts available power when needed, ensuring optimal performance.</li> <li><strong>True Sine Wave Inverter:</strong> Provides&nbsp;clean and reliable AC power, capable of running most appliances seamlessly. Delivers exceptional peak power surge capacity for handling demanding loads.</li> <li><strong>Advanced Battery Charger:</strong> The intelligent multi-stage charger ensures optimal charging for various battery types (wet, AGM, GEL, Li-ion), extending battery life.</li> <li><strong>Uninterrupted AC Power (UPS):</strong> In the event of a grid failure or power interruption, the <em>MultiPlus-II</em> seamlessly takes over within milliseconds, keeping your devices powered without disruption.</li> <li><strong>Ideal for Energy Storage Systems (ESS):</strong>&nbsp;The MultiPlus II is perfect for use in combination with MPPT solar chargers and other Victron energy devices. In the event of a grid failure, or when shore or generator power is disconnected, the <em>MultiPlus</em> can act as a UPS, providing uninterrupted AC power. It does this by activating its inverter to take over supply to your connected loads. It's able to do this in less than 20 milliseconds, which is so fast that even complex electronic devices such as computers will operate without disruption.</li> <li><strong>Expandable Power:</strong> Up to 6 units can operate in parallel for significantly increased power output. Ideal for high-demand applications.</li> <li><strong>Remote Monitoring &amp; Control (Optional):</strong> When paired with a GX device (e.g., Cerbo GX), you can monitor and control your <em>MultiPlus-II</em> remotely via the free VRM app and VRM portal website. Accessible from anywhere in the world using your smartphone, tablet, laptop, or PC.</li> <li><strong>External Current Transformer Option:</strong>&nbsp;The <em>MultiPlus-II</em> enables enhanced PowerControl and PowerAssist functionality, allowing for precise current sensing (up to 32A) for optimized self-consumption.</li> <li><strong>Built-in Anti-Islanding:</strong> Provides crucial safety for off-grid applications by preventing the inverter from feeding electricity back to the utility grid in case of a disconnect.</li> </ul> <h3>Specifications:</h3> <table class=""table table-striped""
