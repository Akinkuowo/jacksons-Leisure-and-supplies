Its modern design features a dark grey front panel and a full-width handle for effortless opening. A key feature is its configurable interior. You can use it solely as a fridge, a dedicated freezer, or a combination of both! The removable 4.4-litre freezer compartment offers flexibility based on your needs.</p> <h2><strong>Dometic NRX50 Key Features:</strong></h2> <ul> <li><strong>What's New?:</strong> The Dometic NRX50 12v Campervan &amp; Motorhome Fridge achieves top ratings in energy consumption, gaining a 9% improvement compared to the previous CRX model (<em>CRX50</em>). This translates to lower energy use and reduced battery drain on your vehicle's electrical system.</li> <li><strong>3-in-1 Cooling Solution:&nbsp;</strong>This innovative feature provides the ultimate in versatility. Need a spacious campervan fridge for a weekend trip? Simply remove the freezer compartment. Going on a longer camping trip and require frozen food storage? Keep the freezer compartment in place. The removable design allows you to adjust the configuration to perfectly suit your requirements.</li> <li><strong>Energy-Efficient with 3 Modes:&nbsp;</strong>The premium compressor features three operational modes: Eco, Boost, and Silent. Eco mode prioritizes low energy consumption, ideal for extended use while preserving cooling performance. Conversely, Boost mode rapidly cools down the Dometic NRX50 Campervan &amp; Motorhome Fridge after restocking groceries. Finally, Silent mode minimizes noise output, perfect for night-time use or enjoying the peacefulness of the outdoors.</li> <li><strong>Space-Saving Design:</strong>&nbsp;The bevelled rear side maximizes space utilization, particularly valuable in compact areas like your campervan or motorhome. This thoughtful design ensures the fridge fits seamlessly without compromising valuable living space.</li> <li><strong>Reversible Door Hinge for Easy Installation:</strong>&nbsp;The door hinge can be conveniently mounted on either the left or right side of the unit. This flexibility allows you to configure the Dometic NRX50 Dometic Campervan &amp; Motorhome Fridge's layout to best suit the available space in your vehicle.</li> <li><strong>Dual Function Locks with Ventilation:</strong>&nbsp;The <em>Dometic NRX50 12v Campervan &amp; Motorhome Fridge&nbsp;</em>features locks that serve a double purpose. They secure the contents of the refrigerator while also functioning as vents. During periods of non-use, you can activate the vent function to promote air circulation and prevent moisture build-up inside the fridge.</li> <li><strong>Winter Mode for All-Weather Performance:&nbsp;</strong>Even in colder climates, the Winter Mode ensures optimal performance. This mode creates a slight gap between the door and the fridge body, allowing for air circulation to prevent moisture build-up and potential mould growth.</li> </ul> <h3>Manuals:<br /><a title=""Download NRX50 Operating Manual"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/dometic/Dometic_NRX_50_Operating_Manual.pdf"" target=""_blank""><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""Download Dometic NRX50 Operating Manual"" src=""https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-fkhd5nhp/product_images/uploaded_images/download-manual-1.png"" alt=""Download Dometic NRX50 Operating Manual"" width=""246"" height=""89"" /></a></h3> <p><a title=""Download NRX50 Installation Guide"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/dometic/Dometic_NRX_50_Installation_Manual.pdf"" target=""_blank""><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""Download Dometic NRX50 Installation Manual"" src=""https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-fkhd5nhp/product_images/uploaded_images/pdf-instructions.jpg"" alt=""Download Dometic NRX50 Installation Manual"" width=""246"" height=""89"" /></a></p> <h2>Diagnostics</h2> <ul> <li><a title=""CRX Flashes"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/dometic/CR50%20Flashes%20Chart.jpg"" target=""_blank"">CR/CRX Flashes Chart</a></li> <li><a title=""Danfoss Diagnostics"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/dometic/Danfoss%20Diagnostics.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Danfoss Compressor Diagnostics</a></li> <li><a title=""Coolmatic Troubleshooter"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/dometic/coolmatic-cr-troubleshooter.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Coolmatic CR Troubleshooter</a></li> </ul>",569.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,"The Dometic NRX 50 comes with a 2 year manufacturer warranty.",0.1000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,Y,"In stock & sent on a next working day carrier!",none,30,0,"Fridges & Coolboxes/Fridges;Fridges & Coolboxes/Fridges/Compressor;Fridges & Coolboxes;Fridges & Coolboxes/Fridges/Compressor/Under Counter (Max height 821mm)",19995,w/860/nrx-50c-9620001481-p400__54707.jpg,"Dometic NRX 50C Campervan Caravan Motorhome 12v Compressor Fridge",Y,0,19997,l/956/nrx-50c-9620001481-p402__15981.jpg,"NRX50 12v Campervan Motorhome Compressor Fridge",N,1,20007,d/247/NRX50_TRUCK_REFRIDGERATOR_DIMENSIONS__75827.jpg,"Dometic NRX 50 12v Compressor Fridge Dimensions",N,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"9620001481, NRX, CRX, NRX50, CRX50, NRX50S, NRX50C, NRX 50S, NRX 50C, 12v Compressor Fridge, Campervan Fridge, Motorhome Fridge, Caravan Fridge, Dometic Fridge, Under counter fridge, Fridge,","Dometic NRX 50 12V Compressor Fridge","Dometic NRX50C, Dometic, NRX50, NRX 50, CRX 50, 12V compressor fridge, compressor fridge, 12v fridge, 50L, 3-in-1 fridge freezer, campervan fridge, motorhome fridge, campervan fridge, motorhome fridge, energy efficient fridge, Dometic fridge, CRX50, 9620001481, NRX50C, NRX 50C, NRX50S, NRX 50S, 50L Fridge,","The Dometic NRX50C 12v Campervan Fridge, successor to the popular CRX50, is a 44L compressor fridge with a sleek design and 3-in-1 configurability.

Available in various sizes, our curved campervan windows cater to your needs.&nbsp; The Adventurer curved campervan windows prioritise stability and durability by incorporating an aluminium frame and stainless steel strut rods (with the exception of the 818 x 315mm version which comes with plastic struts). These enhanced features ensure a robust structure and reliable performance for your campervan adventures.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Privacy is key</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">With a dark tinted double glazed window and pleated blind and flyscreen within a PVC frame, the Adventurer Curved Frame low profile window adds privacy and helps to keep light out. The flyscreen also helps to provide airflow yet keep bugs out.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Easy installation</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">A window mounting frame which follows the curvature of your campervan van conversion sides with a maximum wall thickness of 26-50mm makes for easy installation on most vehicles and a wide range of window sizes in a stylish black colour will compliment most colour schemes well. It is suggested that a timber frame is bonded to the inside of the vehicle to add rigidity to the van's sides. The timber fame can be built up from thinner strips of ply to follow the curve of the campervans sides.</p> <h3>Adventurer Curved Top Hung Hinged Windows Specifications</h3> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""> <li>Aluminium alloy flat frame finished in black</li> <li>Thermal insulation</li> <li>Double glazed acrylic window</li> <li>Choose between black or white internal frame and blind</li> <li>UV resistant</li> <li>Curvature radius of 5000mm</li> <li>Adjustable window stays</li> <li>Handle without lock</li> <li>Pleated blind with an Aluminium frame</li> <li>Wall thickness mounting size: 26-50mm frame</li> <li>Suitable for caravan motorhome or campervan</li> </ul> <div style=""overflow-x: auto;

During the test we register the maximum (MAX) speed impact a tent was subjected and the average (AVG) wind speed at which structural instability occurred. This may appear as a broken/deformed pole, or the collapse of the tent and subsequent return to shape when the wind drops.
