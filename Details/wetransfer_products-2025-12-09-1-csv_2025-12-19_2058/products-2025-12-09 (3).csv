Application is easy thanks to the peel and stick backing of the Deadn Pro/Hex sheets. The 50 sheet pack of the Hex will approximately provide 4.7 sq.m of coverage,&nbsp;usually sufficient for VW T5 or similar sized pop top campervans.&nbsp;However, the slightly thicker Deadn Pro pack consisting of 40 sheets and provides coverage of approximately 3.7 sq.m with an improved level of sound reduction.&nbsp;</p> <p>Once the Deadn sheets have been applied to the interior of the campervan, the second sound reducing, and additional insulative layer, can be applied. Again, there is a choice of either Liner XPE or Liner Pro, in these kits, and it is placed on the campervan sides, roof and floor as needed. Being constructed of closed cell foam of 6mm&nbsp;in thickness, both provide additional sound reducing qualities and an insulating layer helping to regulate temperature within the rear cab area of the campervan.</p> <h3>Automotive designed quality materials for easy fit and forget installation</h3> <p>The Dodo range of products within these kits have been designed for simple, effective and trouble free installation in medium sized campervan vehicles. Using strong adhesives, quality closed cell foam with embossed aluminium layer, the kits make the initial stages of van conversion easy. Products have been tested to ensure they are safe for vehicle interiors and resistant to extreme heat.&nbsp;These kits are available in either a Standard or Pro version and both come complete with a heavy duty Mat Pro Metal Roller for improved adhesive bonding of sound deadening sheets.</p> <p>We strongly recommend ensuring the surface to be covered with Deadn Hex/Pro and Liner products are degreased prior to application to ensure the best possible adhesion.</p> <h3>Dodo Sound Deadening Medium Campervan Kit Contains:</h3> <h3>Pro Kit</h3> <ul> <li>Dodo Deadn Pro Bulk Pack (40 sheets) x 1</li> <li>Dodo Thermo Liner Pro 6mm (3sq.m roll) x 2</li> <li>Dodo Mat Pro Metal Roller x 1</li> </ul> <h3>Standard Kit</h3> <ul> <li>Dodo Deadn Hex Bulk Pack (50 sheets) x 1</li> <li>Dodo Thermo Liner XPE 6mm (3sq.m roll) x 1</li> <li>Dodo Mat Pro Metal Roller x 1</li> </ul> <h3>&nbsp;Recommended For Medium Campervan Size Vehicles</h3> <ul> <li>Ford Custom</li> <li>Mercedes Vito</li> <li>PSA Van - Dispatch/Expert/Scudo</li> <li>Toyota Proace</li> <li>Vauxhall Vivaro/Renault Trafic/Nissan NV300</li> <li>Volkswagen T5/T6</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",204.90,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.1000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,N,,none,0,0,"Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Conversion Equipment/Lining & Insulation",16754,f/845/Deadn-Sound-Dead-Med-Camper-Standard-kit__47357.jpg,"Deadn Sound Deadening Medium Campervan Standard Kit",Y,0,16753,j/902/Deadn-Sound-Dead-Med-Camper-Pro-kit__48567.jpg,"Deadn Sound Deadening Medium Campervan Pro Kit",N,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"DODO, deadn, insulation, sound deadening, hex, xpe,  thermo liner, liner, pro, ","Dodo Deadn Sound Deadening Kit For Medium Sized Campervans","DODO, deadn, insulation, sound deadening, hex, xpe,  thermo liner, liner, pro, ","A complete sound deadening installation kit from Dodo suitable for medium sized campervans",,,,New,N,N,,N,,,0,"Default Tax Class",,N,/campervan/lining-insulation/dodo/deadn/medium-campervan/kit/,,,,,

Product,3536,"Dodo Deadn Medium Panel Van Sound Deadening Kit",P,DODO-MED-PV-KIT,,,"Dodo Deadn Kit Type",Right,"<h1>Dodo Sound Deadening Kits For Medium Panel Van Vehicles</h1> <h2>Complete sound deadening kit</h2> <p>Correct sound deadening can reduce the 'tinny' sound often associated with panel vans on the road. These sound deadening kits featuring Dodo products, will take that noisy road buzz out of journeys. Improving the audible quality of the ride, means occupants will feel less fatigued and warmer thanks to the closed cell insulation interior. Available as either a Standard or Pro kit, they both include sound deadening panels, Thermo Liner and a Dodo Metal Roller, simply choose the insulation properties required for your installation.</p> <h3>Reduce noise and improve thermal quality</h3> <p>Ideally, Dodo Deadn Pro/Hex sheets should be used to cover approximately 50-70% of the single skin area of the vehicle. This should include panels, wheel arches and doors. Thanks to the easy peel and stick backing of the Deadn Pro/Hex sheets, apply in required position and using the roller, ensure a secure fit. The Deadn Pro and Hex packs come in 4.7sq.m and 3.7 sq.m packs respectively, and with two packs in each kit, this should provide sufficient coverage for medium sized panel vans such as ???.</p> <p>Once the Deadn sheets have been affixed in the required areas, the second layer, either Liner Pro 6mm or Liner XPE 6mm, is applied. These closed cell foam liners provide additional noise reduction qualities as well as improving the thermal insulation of the panel van. This thermal layer can be applied to roof, floor and van sides, and being constructed from closed cell foam will not absorb moisture and are crush resistant. The adhesive backing protector is grid lined to aid cutting and can easily be shaped with the appropriate knife or scissors. Once in place, the strong adhesive will keep the liner in place and is resistant to extreme heats that can occur in vehicles.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Automotive designed quality materials for easy fit and forget installation</h3> <p>These kits has been designed to make insulation easy and straight forward in medium sized panel van vehicles. The combination of string adhesives, premium quality closed cell foam, aluminium foil backed panels and easy to trim, yet robust materials, these kits make fitting easy. However, to ensure the best possible adhesion of Deadn panels and liners to surfaces, it is&nbsp;strongly recommend to degrease the surface prior to application to ensure the best possible adhesion.</p> <h3>Dodo Sound Deadening Medium Panel Van Kit Contains:</h3> <h3>Pro Kit</h3> <ul> <li>Dodo Deadn Pro Bulk Pack (40 sheets) x 2</li> <li>Dodo Thermo Liner Pro 6mm (3sq.m roll) x 5</li> <li>Dodo Mat Pro Metal Roller x 1</li> </ul> <h3>Standard Kit</h3> <ul> <li>Dodo Deadn Hex Bulk Pack (50 sheets) x 2</li> <li>Dodo Thermo Liner XPE 6mm (3sq.m roll) x 2</li> <li>Dodo Mat Pro Metal Roller x 1</li> </ul> <h3>&nbsp;Recommended For Medium Panel Van Size Vehicles</h3> <ul> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">Ford Custom</span></li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">Mercedes Vito</span></li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">PSA Van - Dispatch/Expert/Scudo</span></li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">Toyota Proace</span></li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">Vauxhall Vivaro/Renault Trafic/Nissan NV300</span></li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">Volkswagen T5/T6</span></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p>",204.90,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.1000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,N,,none,0,0,"Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Conversion Equipment/Lining & Insulation",16757,p/030/Deadn-Sound-Dead-Med-Camper-Standard-kit__55464.jpg,"Deadn Sound Deadening Medium Campervan Standard Kit",Y,0,16758,m/309/Deadn-Sound-Dead-Med-Camper-Pro-kit__75499.jpg,"Deadn Sound Deadening Medium Campervan Pro Kit",N,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"DODO, deadn, insulation, sound deadening, hex, xpe,  thermo liner, liner, pro, ","Dodo Deadn Sound Deadening Kit For Medium Sized Campervans","DODO, deadn, insulation, sound deadening, hex, xpe,  thermo liner, liner, pro, ","A complete sound deadening installation kit from Dodo suitable for medium sized campervans",,,,New,N,N,,N,,,0,"Default Tax Class",,N,/campervan/lining-insulation/copy-of-dodo-deadn-medium-campervan-sound-deadening-kit/,,,,,

Product,3735,"Crusader Black & Grey Motorhome CoverPro ",P,W370,,Crusader,"Crusader Motorhome Cover Size Options",Right,"<h1>Crusader Black &amp; Grey Motorhome CoverPro</h1> <h2>Protective Weatherproof Motorhome Cover</h2> <p>With six sizes to fit most motorhome vehicles, this functional black and grey cover provides a great fit to your motorhome. The CoverPro offers a waterproof barrier to motorhomes from 5.7 metres to 8 metres in length. Designed with a robust multi layer system featuring non woven polypropylene fabric, the CoverPro allows breathability to prevent a build up of damp and water ingress. In addition to providing waterproof protection, the cover also helps prevent unsightly dirt, water marks and birdlime during extended storage.</p> <h3>Accessibility During Winter Storage</h3> <p>For added convenience, the Crusader Motorhome CoverPro comes complete with high level zips on both driver and passenger side allowing access to your motorhome. This feature provides accessibility to the interior of the motorhome when changing damp reducing crystals or simply for preparing your motorhome prior to your next holiday or weekend break. When the cover is not required, it can be easily stored in the storage bag included.</p> <h3>Breathable Cover</h3> <p>The breathable 4-ply layered design of this motorhome cover allows moisture that may accumulate under the cover to evaporate and escape from the surface, helping to prevent mould growth. the material is also UV stable for added peace of mind. Adjustable straps on all four sides of the motorhome enable a secure, customised fit to reduce movement in strong winds.</p> <p><strong>Please note</strong> - For motorhomes with cab humps it is recommended to go up one size. Also for motorhomes with aerials, satellite equipment or any other ancillary items, that may cause a snag on the cover, it is recommended to cover the equipment with a box or similar protective item. It may be necessary to size up in order to have extra material to cover roof mounted items.</p> <h3>Specifications</h3> <ul> <li>Weight when boxed: 16kg</li> <li>Packsize cm (H x W x D): 58 x 50 x 50cm</li> </ul> <table style=""width: 815px; height: 190px;"" border=""1""> <tbody> <tr> <td style=""background-color: #5e9237; text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;""><strong>Part No.</strong></span></td> <td style=""background-color: #5e9237; text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;""><strong>Size</strong></span></td> <td style=""background-color: #5e9237; text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;""><strong>Will fit motorhomes between (m)</strong></span></td> <td style=""background-color: #5e9237; text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;""><strong>Cover Weight</strong></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">W371</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">1</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">up to 5.7m Long</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">16kg</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">W372</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">2</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">5.7-6m Long</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">16kg</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">W373</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">3</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">6-6.5m Long</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">16kg</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">W374</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">4</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">6.5-7m Long</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">16kg</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">W375</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">5</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">7-7.5m Long</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">16kg</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">W376</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">6</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">7.5-8m Long</span></td> <td style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva;"">16kg</span></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",149.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.1000,50.0000,58.0000,50.0000,Y,Y,"# Estimated Lead time 1-2 Weeks",none,0,0,"Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Protective Covers",19100,u/797/motorhome_cover__45694.jpg,"Crusader CoverPro Motorhome Protective Cover",Y,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crusader, CoverPro, Cover, Waterproof, motorhome, protective, W372, W371, W373, W374, W375, W376, winter cover, ","Crusader CoverPro Protective Motorhome Winter Cover","Crusader, CoverPro, Cover, Waterproof, motorhome, protective, W372, W371, W373, W374, W375, W376, winter cover, ","Protective waterproof breathable motorhome cover with side access zips",,,,New,N,N,,N,,,0,"Default Tax Class",,N,/caravan-campervan-motorhome/caravan-covers/crusader-products-black-grey-motorhome-coverpro-fits-motorhomes/,,,,,
