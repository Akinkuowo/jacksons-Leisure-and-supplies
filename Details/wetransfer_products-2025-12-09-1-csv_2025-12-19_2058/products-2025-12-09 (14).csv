Product,367,"Above Ground Swimming Pool Overlap Liners",P,"OVERLAP LINER",,,"Overlap Liners",Right,"<h1>Above Ground Swimming Pool Overlap Liners</h1> <p>An <strong>Above Ground Overlap Swimming Pool Liner</strong> is perfect for use as a replacement liner or as the first liner on a new pool. An overlap liner does exactly what the name implies, and folds (or overlaps) over the pool wall and is then secured onto the exterior. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span></p> <h3>A basic guide to installing your overlap liner successfully:</h3> <ul> <li>Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t attempt to install a liner on a windy day! As these are stretch in liners, the ideal weather conditions for them are warm and dry. The liner will be far more malleable and easy to install in this kind of weather &ndash; anything less than warm and dry and you could find yourself struggling to install a cold, brittle and inflexible liner!</li> <li>It&rsquo;s important to make sure that you prepare the base well prior to installation. Remove imperfections in the soil with dust or fine chippings, and also completely clear any debris from the site.</li> <li>When creating your one piece floor with polystyrene sheets (taped together into place with fibre tape), make sure that they&rsquo;re inside but not under the metal wall.</li> </ul> <p>For more information regarding overlap liners, installation or even advice about installing a replacement liner, please give us a call on: <strong>0151 334 0222</strong>.</p> <h2>Liner Thickness:</h2> <ul> <li>17 thou (Wall thickness)</li> <li>13 thou (Floor thickness)</li> </ul> <table style=""width: 617px;

Each kit includes optional lenses, having a mix of lights with and without lenses randomly scattered across the ceiling adds to a ""real"" star affect.</p> <h3>Colour Changing (Manual Control)</h3> <p>This star ceiling kit has an LED light source (light box) and provides an RGBW sequence (red green blue white), it can be manually set on the light box to stay at a fixed colour or go through a set colour change sequence.&nbsp; Remember you will need access to the box if you want to change the setting, if it&rsquo;s in your loft you&rsquo;ll have to get up to change it.</p> <h3>Colour Changing (with Remote Control)</h3> <p>This LED light star ceiling kit has a remote control which can turn the lights on/off, set a fixed colour or change to an RBG colour changing sequence, the brightness can also be adjusted with the remote. The LED light kits do <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>not</strong></span> have a twinkling affect!</p> <h3>112 Light points</h3> <p>The Small Star Effect Ceiling Light Kit features 112 Star Points with fibre lengths ranging from 1.2m to 2m, this has the option for an extra metre to be added to these lengths, available with a choice of three different light sources (Twinkle Wheel, Manual Colour Changer or Colour Changer with remote control).
