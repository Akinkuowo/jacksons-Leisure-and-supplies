Product,1913,"Winbond Ultra Cure - Campervan Window Installation Kit",P,101003K1,,Winbond,,Right,"<h1>Winbond Ultra Cure - Campervan Window Installation Kit</h1> <h2>Complete installation kit for bonded campervan windows</h2> <p>Featuring a specialised adhesive for installing windows to vehicles, this window installation kit contains all that you need to securely fix glass windows to your campervan. Ultra Cure is a rapid curing formula, providing easy installation.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Includes primer, applicators and more</h2> <p>This kit includes as standard a wipe to clean the surface, specialised primer to prepare the surface for the adhesive, applicators to ease installation, a cartridge of adhesive, a nozzle, instructions and gloves. The Winbond Glass Wipe 'activates' the glass surface, whilst also cleaning and degreasing the surface. The Winbond Glass Primer forms a barrier against UV light, since UV can degrade PU adhesive rapidly. Detailed usage, safety and installation instructions are supplied with each kit.</p> <h2>Usage tips</h2> <p>We recommend you store your adhesive indoors for a couple of days to ensure it is at room temperature - this eases application. It's best to wait a minimum of 2-4 hours before using your vehicle when installing windows. Follow the instructions carefully for the best results.</p> <h3>Winbond Ultra Cure Kit - Contents:</h3> <ul> <li>1x Winbond Ultra Cure adhesive - 310ml</li> <li>1x Winbond Black Glass/Paint Surface - 30ml</li> <li>1x Winbond Glass Wipe activator/cleaner</li> <li>1x Soft tip applicator</li> <li>1x Pair of gloves</li> <li>1x Nozzle</li> <li>1x Instructions</li> </ul> <h3>Winbond Ultra Cure Kit - Window Installation Instructions:</h3> <p><a title=""Winbond Ultra Cure Window Installation Guide"" href=""https://www.jacksonsleisure.com/content/pdf/winbond/winbond-installation-instructions.pdf"" target=""_blank""><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""Winbond Ultra Cure Window Installation Guide"" src=""https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-fkhd5nhp/product_images/uploaded_images/download-manual.jpg"" alt=""Winbond Ultra Cure Window Installation Guide"" width=""202"" height=""73"" /></a></p>",24.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.1000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,Y,"Fast delivery options available!","by product",16,0,"Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Windows & Rooflights;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Windows & Rooflights/Van Glass Windows;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Conversion Equipment/Windows;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Conversion Equipment/Windows/Adhesive and Trim",14924,e/821/DSC06579-JLS__49486.jpg,"Winbond Ultra Cure window adhesive kit",Y,0,14931,r/019/DSC06586-JLS__13707.jpg,"Winbond ultra cure single cartridge kit",N,1,14928,l/947/DSC06585-JLS__14214.jpg,"Winbond bonding adhesive for fixing windows to campervans",N,2,14932,i/240/DSC06587-JLS__96822.jpg,"Winbond primer and wipe with PU adhesive kit",N,3,14930,r/125/DSC06588-JLS__30537.jpg,"Winbond applicator for automotive window glass pane adhesive",N,4,14922,u/546/DSC06590-JLS__64182.jpg,"Winbond ultra cure adhesive for installing bonded windows to campervans",N,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dinitrol, Bonded, JC7286,101003K1,winbond,","Winbond Ultra Cure - Campervan Window Installation Kit","Dinitrol, Bonded, Window, Campervan, Motorhome, Conversion, Starter Kit, JC7286,101003K1","Handy kit with all you need to fit one or more bonded windows to your campervan conversion.

Product,1921,"Thule Omnistor 4200 Awning",P,4200,,Thule,"Thule Omnistor 4200",Right,"<h1>Thule Omnistor 4200 Awning for Motorhome and Campervan</h1> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Thule Omnistor awning range is regarded as the best wall-mounted awnings for motorhomes.&nbsp;The <em>Thule Omnistor 4200</em> is suitable for campervans and motorhomes. Available in a range of lengths from 2.6m to 4.5m the <em>Thule Omnistor 4200</em>&nbsp;awning has a maximum projection of 2.5m with cassettes also available in white, anodised grey and anthracite black.&nbsp;The <em>Thule Omnistor 4200</em> comes with a Mystic Grey awning colour.</p> <h2>Best Wall Mounted Awning</h2> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Superseding the 4900 model, the Omnistor 4200 awning features a new end cap design that&nbsp;ensures a sleek, integrated look on your camper. Opening and closing the awning cannot be easier thanks to the useful telescopic hand crank. Featuring sealing rubber that uses an integrated drainage system to drain water off of the awning. Ensuring no water build-up and keeps you protected in rainy weather.</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">A huge weight reduction has been applied thanks to a small roller tube support which keeps the awning stable. One of the lightest awnings in the market with the 2.6m x 2.00m model weighing just at 17kg. The risk of damage to your vehicle has also been reduced with the oval support legs being dropped vertically.

Product,1958,"Bowman Hot Tub and Spa Pool Heat Exchanger",P,,,Bowmans,"Bowman EC80",Right,"<h1>Bowman Hot Tub Spa Heat Exchanger</h1> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Bowman Heat Exchanger is a cost effective and energy efficient way to heat your Spa, Hot Tub or swimming pool. Available in 3 models with tube stacks constructed from Cupro Nickel (1C), Stainless Steel (1S) or Titanium (1T). The Titanium tube stack offers durability and is highly resistant to chemical attack in the Spa or Hot Tub carrying a 10 year guarantee.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Energy Saving</h2> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Traditionally most Spa and Hot Tub are heated using 3kW electric heaters which are slow and expensive to run. By using a Bowman Heat Exchanger in conjunction with a gas or biomass boiler heat up times and energy usage are reduced. As electricity is approximately twice as expensive per kWh for heating the savings can be considerable.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Environmental Benefit</h2> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to the Energy Saving Trust gas produces less than half the carbon dioxide per kilowatt that electricity produces.</p> <h2>Compact and Easy to Install</h2> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The compact Bowman EC80 Spa Hot Tub Heat Exchanger is just 368mm long enabling easy installation with the supplied solvent weld connectors in imperial and metric sizes. Bowman heat exchangers are supplied with removable composite ends and tubestacks for easy maintenance.</p> <p>An integral 7mm thermostat pocket is built in to the Bowman EC80 Hot Tub Spa Pool Heat Exchanger.</p> <p>Please note that as for all metal fittings within a pool or hot tub system the water chemistry must be balanced (especially pH) to avoid chemical damage.</p> <h3><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">If you have a salt chlorination system in the pool you need to use a Titanium heat exchanger.</span></h3> <table class=""table table-striped"" style=""width: 725px; height: 206px;"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""5""> <tbody> <tr> <td class=""tabletopcolor"" rowspan=""2"" width=""23""> <div align=""center"">Code</div> </td> <td class=""tabletopcolor"" colspan=""2""> <div align=""center"">Spa/Pool Capacity</div> </td> <td class=""tabletopcolor"" colspan=""2""> <div align=""center"">Heat Transfer 82&deg;C</div> </td> <td class=""tabletopcolor"" colspan=""2""> <div align=""center"">Heat Transfer 60&deg;C</div> </td> <td class=""tabletopcolor"" colspan=""2""> <div align=""center"">Boiler Flow</div> </td> <td class=""tabletopcolor"" colspan=""2""> <div align=""center"">Max.

Combined with the digital Truma I-net X control panel, the Combi D4E provides fingertip control over heater functions when needed.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Versatile Operation</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Depending upon your needs this kit can operate on either 230V electric mains voltage, with diesel fuel or both together. The Truma Combi D4E heater model can provide hot water, and a warm living space, whether on a mains powered camping site, or out off-grid in the wild. For quickly heating your motorhome or caravan when on pitched up on site, you can use both electric and diesel energy sources in conjunction for rapid heating speeds.</p> <h3>The Truma Combi D4E Kit Includes</h3> <ul> <li>Truma Combi D4E diesel and electric heater unit</li> <li>Truma iNet X digital control panel</li> <li>John Guest water kit</li> <li>6 metres control panel cable</li> <li>Truma Combi diesel exhaust kit&nbsp;</li> <li>Truma universal fuel take off kit (works with most vehicle standard fuel senders)</li> <li>Japan Solderless Terminal electrical ends</li> <li>Truma installation and operation instructions</li> <li>Frost control unit</li> <li>Please note that the Truma&nbsp;Room Temperature Sensor Cable is not included in the kit.</li> <li>Please note - New installations will require warm air distribution ducting.</li> </ul> <h3>Truma iNet X control panel with Bluetooth iNet X App</h3> <p>The Combi D4E kit from Truma includes the innovative I-Net X digital control panel.

Available in Black or Light Grey colour.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Key Features of the Vitrifrigo SLIM150</h2> <h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Angled roof and base to accommodate your motor home or boats curves!</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">At just 400mm wide and 450mm deep (front to back including the doors the SLIM150 also has an angled top and base to fit the curvature of the vehicle roof and floor of the vehicle.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Compressor is separate from the fridge freezer</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">To further maximise the volume of the Vitrifrigo SLIM150 the compressor is separate to the cabinet, supplied pre-charged with couplings, allowing it to be remotely mounted and then connected to the cabinet once installed. For marine applications this also gives us the option to water cool the compressor with the addition of a keel cooler, improving efficiency and saving power.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Finally a slim fridge freezer for your Motorhome or boat that ticks all the boxes</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The main fridge with internal freezer compartment sits above a drawer fridge below. The fridge has an internal LED light, two 'lock in' shelves with fiddle up stands (plus the dividing shelf between the fridge and drawer below). The 16 litre insulated internal freezer box is 3 star rated. The internal height of the drawer is 365mm making it ideal for storage of large drinks bottles.&nbsp; The SLIM150 doors use Vitrifrigo's innovative AIRLOCK catch system and both doors have a vent position to prevent unpleasant smells when the fridge is turned off.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Fast chill boost along with quiet running at night</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Vitrifrigo SLIM150 is controlled by a LED thermostat, with a graduated light to show how cold the temperature is set. It also has a fast chill boost setting to bring the fridge freezer down to temperature quicker and a night mode when the compressor is switched to its economy mode and the noise is minimised.&nbsp; The Vitrifrigo SLIM150 is powered with a BD50 12/24 volt compressor, which can be easily upgraded to 12/24V and 110/240V.<br /><br /></p> <h1 style=""text-align: center;"">&nbsp;</h1> <h3>&nbsp;<img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" style=""float: left;"" title=""Vitrifrigo DP144 (Slim 150)"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server1100/fkhd5nhp/product_images/uploaded_images/mode-1aa.jpg"" alt=""Vitrifrigo DP144 (Slim 150) frigoboat"" width=""85"" height=""84"" />Night Mode</h3> <p>Lowest noise level and reduced consumption during night time.
