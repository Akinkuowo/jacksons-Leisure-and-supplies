Once you find your favorite spot, the hole is dug, a concrete slab is poured and the pool is placed on top.

The design is sleek, elegant and minimalistic with an LED light curve to complement your caravan / motorhome's aesthetics and provide an element of ambiance at night. Despite its impressive 2516W of cooling power, the FreshJet 3000 maintains a quiet noise profile due to the patented dual-cylinder inverter, which balances the system to provide quiet and efficient operation. The efficiency of the unit means it has a very low starting current, allowing smooth operation even on campsites with low electrical protection.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Modern Motorhome Air Conditioning Powered by Smart Technology</h2> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Dometic Freshjet FJX7 3000 Rooftop Air Conditioner is equipped with Smart connectivity features, which will allow users to control the heating through a range of convenient touchpoints, such as the smart phone app, a remote control or the built-in touch screen interface. The compressor does not work via traditional method of an On/Off switch, but via Integrated Smart Technology. The compressor adapts automatically to environmental demands, helping to save both time from adjusting the temperature and energy from turning the device on and off throughout the day. The air conditioner is the perfect addition to help modify any caravan or motorhome into a mobile smart mobile-home! The integrated CleanAir system helps to maintain Air Quality within a Caravan or Motorhome by keeping the air fresh and clear, and working to remove allergens, bacteria and mould. You can switch between heating and cooling, set a desired temperature, dehumidify, ventilate, set a desired temperature - or simply activate auto mode. For the winter months, the unit comes equipped with a mighty 3107W of heating power to keep you and your loved ones warm. The unit also features integrated bright LED lighting, which can be activated via the remote control.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Sleek and Compact Caravan Air Conditioning</h2> <p>The Dometic FreshJet FJX7 3000 Roof Air Conditioner is one of the most lightweight and ultra-compact motorhome / caravan air conditioners in all of Europe.
