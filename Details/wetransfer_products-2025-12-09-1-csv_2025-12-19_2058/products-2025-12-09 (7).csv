Inbuilt 40A&nbsp;MPPT solar charge controller:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>This Feature is a high efficiency MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) controller which regulates the&nbsp;input from the&nbsp;solar panels to the batteries or to load</p> <p>The Iconica IC-BM1000 has a full range of&nbsp;safety functions including protection against overcharging of batteries, overheating of system, reverse current etc.</p> <p>The MPPT controller operates at up to&nbsp;<strong>98% efficiency&nbsp;</strong>to extract the maximum possible power from the solar array.</p> <p><strong>3. Enhanced 20A Smart battery charger:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>This Feature is designed to enable safe and efficient unattended charging of a&nbsp;battery from a mains power source or generator, with full overcharge protection and multiple charging stages.</p> <h2>Additional Smart Features</h2> <p>The Iconica 1000W 12V hybrid inverter boasts many unique features, providing enhanced functionality over standard inverters.</p> <p>These include:</p> <p><strong>Output source priority:&nbsp;</strong>This intelligent feature allows the user to set output source preferences(solar/ battery power/ mains input or a generator) for the AC load output of the inverter. This menu includes several options for varying conditions and scenarios, e.g. which source of energy is given priority for the AC output if solar power is insufficient/ if battery voltage is too low/ if mains is unavailable, etc.</p> <p><strong>Battery charging priority:</strong>&nbsp;A wide selection of battery charging priority options are available. For instance, the user can choose to charge the battery using solar power only/ using a combination of solar power and mains power/ from mains power only etc.</p> <p><strong>A range of highly customisable settings:</strong>&nbsp;The parameters for this&nbsp;inverter can be personalised to an exceptionally specific degree via the&nbsp;user-friendly interface. At the touch of a button, the user can&nbsp;customise parameters such as the AC input range, battery type, max charging current, specific high/low voltage disconnect points (and preferred charging source upon reconnection), the duration and voltage of each charging stage,&nbsp;auto-restart options, power saving mode, overload&nbsp;bypass,&nbsp;battery equalization stage characteristics and so on. There&nbsp;are also&nbsp;options&nbsp;for managing&nbsp;operational features such as&nbsp;the audible alarm and backlight settings.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Illuminated LCD screen:</strong>&nbsp;Displays vital statistics which are&nbsp;easily changeable by use of the up/down keys. This information includes: status and mode, input/output voltage, frequency, battery voltage, load power and percentages, charge and discharge current etc.</p> <p><strong>Advanced communication options:</strong>&nbsp;The inverter is supplied with a PC connection cable and PC software&nbsp;for convenient viewing of important system information, such as: &nbsp;solar/ battery/ AC voltage, charging current, battery capacity&nbsp;etc. Detailed data logs are also available to view and export to PDF/ Excel formats. This inverter also has the potential to send data to an&nbsp;online user porta<strong>l&nbsp;</strong>using a Wi-Fi&nbsp;or 4g Connection Kit&nbsp;(purchased separately).</p> <p>By connecting via either of these two methods, the user will unlock access to exclusive features such as SMS / email status updates for the inverter, remote system monitoring from any location and much more.</p> <p><strong>Auto restart function:&nbsp;</strong>When overload or overheating occurs, the inverter will disconnect the load appliances, and automatically reconnect once safe conditions are detected. The inbuilt fan is helps to maintain an optimal operational temperature.</p> <p><strong>Intelligent cooling design</strong>: The IC-CM1000 inverter uses predictive fan logic based on performance and temperature (1 or 2 fans operating at a time, with variable speeds) to prevent over-heating&nbsp;of the components.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Compatibility</h2> <p><span>The Iconica IC-BM1000 hybrid inverter charger is suitable for 12V&nbsp;</span>flooded<span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span>sealed&nbsp;GEL/AGM<strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>lead-acid batteries with pre-defined charging programs.

Product,2622,"Adventurer (THC) Curved Frame Top Hung Hinged Low Profile Campervan Window - Black Blind",P,,,Adventurer,"THC Window Black",Right,"<h1><span>Adventurer (THC) Curved Radius Frame Top Hinged Campervan&nbsp;Windows - Black Blind</span></h1> <h2><span>Black Aluminium Curved Frame Low Profile Campervan Window with Black Blinds,&nbsp;</span>ideal for panel vans.</h2> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Introducing our new collection of Adventurer Curved Campervan Top Hung Windows, crafted to seamlessly blend with the contours of your van.</p> <h3>Curved frame explained</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Many campervans and van conversions have side walls which have a slight curve running top to bottom, the Adventurer curved frame window matches the curve of your vans walls with a radius.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Practical and Stylish</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">These windows feature a sleek aluminium frame and are fitted with high-quality, tinted double glazed UV resistant acrylic, ensuring both durability and optimal protection against harmful UV rays and privacy. Available in various sizes, our curved campervan windows cater to your needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adventurer curved campervan windows prioritise stability and durability by incorporating an aluminium frame and stainless steel strut rods (with the exception of the 818 x 315mm version which comes with plastic struts). These enhanced features ensure a robust structure and reliable performance for your campervan adventures.</p> <h3>Privacy is key</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">With a tinted double glazed window and pleated blind and flyscreen within a PVC frame, the Adventurer Curved Frame low profile window adds privacy and helps to keep light out. The flyscreen also helps to provide airflow yet keep bugs out.</p> <h3>Easy installation</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">A window mounting frame which follows the curvature of the campervan wall with a thickness of 25-40mm makes for easy installation on most vehicles and a wide range of window sizes in a stylish black colour will compliment most colour schemes well.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;It is suggested that a timber frame is bonded to the inside of the vehicle to add rigidity to the van's sides. The timber fame can be built up from thinner strips of ply to follow the curve of the campervan's sides.</span></p> <h3>Adventurer Curved Top Hung Hinged Windows Specifications</h3> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""> <li>Aluminium alloy flat frame finished in black</li> <li>Double glazed acrylic window</li> <li>UV resistant</li> <li>Vertical Curvature radius of 5000mm</li> <li>Double stainless steel struts (with the exception of 818 x315 frame)</li> <li>Two handle closures</li> <li>Pleated blind and fly screen with PVC frame</li> <li>Wall thickness mounting size: 25-40mm frame</li> <li>Suitable for caravan motorhome van conversion or campervan</li> </ul> <h3>Adventurer Curved Top Hung Hinged Windows Sizes</h3> <table class=""table table-striped"" style=""width: 68%;
