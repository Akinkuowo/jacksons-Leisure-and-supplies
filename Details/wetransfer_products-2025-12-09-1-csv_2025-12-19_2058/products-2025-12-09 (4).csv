BF Goodrich all-terrain tyres use a thicker sidewall and thick grooves for high performance on and off-road, and this means they aren't available with the 20"" rims - if you'd like to discuss alternative tyre choices for this size, please contact us.</p> <h3>Compatibility</h3> <ul> <li>VW T5 Transporter &amp; Caravelle 2003-2009</li> <li>VW T5.1 Transporter &amp; Caravelle 2010-15</li> <li>VW T6 Transporter &amp; Caravelle 2015-19</li> <li>VW T6.1 Transporter &amp; Caravelle 2019 Onwards</li> </ul> <h3>Alloy Specifications</h3> <ul> <li>18"" - 8.5x18""</li> <li>20"" - 9x20""</li> </ul> <h3>BF Goodrich tyre specifications (18"")</h3> <table class=""table table-striped"" border=""0""> <tbody> <tr> <td>Specification</td> <td>Brand</td> <td>Load</td> <td>Speed rating</td> <td>Fuel Rating</td> <td>Wet Grip Rating</td> <td>Noise (dB)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>255/55 R18 BFG ATKO2[6] 109/105R All Terrain +7.43%</td> <td>BF Goodrich</td> <td>105</td> <td>R</td> <td>E</td> <td>B</td> <td>74</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",895.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.1000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,N,Y,"#Contact us for more info",none,0,0,"Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Conversion Equipment/Campervan Specific;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Conversion Equipment/Campervan Specific/Alloy Wheel & Tyres",14910,r/980/wolfrace_explorer_sahara_matt_black_black_rivets__08214.jpg,"Wolfrace VW T5 T6 Explorer Sahara Matt Black Alloy Wheels",Y,0,14913,z/462/103363994_164765388382260_5297358502167248808_n__14698.jpg,"Wolfrace Sahara Alloy wheels for Vw transporter campervans",N,1,14916,s/262/17-Vw-T5-T6-5X120-Alloy-Wheels-Swamper__96894.jpg,"Wolfrace sahara with bf goodrich all terrain off road tyre",N,2,14911,f/359/261439725_2425132777619195_7938410351830269351_n__52205.jpg,"Wolfrace explorer sahara vanspeed all terrrain alloys with bf goodrich",N,3,14912,r/321/267503724_581247176526024_6410339466990778586_n__42829.jpg,"Wolfrace wheels and tyres for vw campervan",N,4,14914,b/893/239486619_375960817308203_664671637304636559_n__37286.jpg,"Wolfrace alloys for vw t5 t6",N,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wolfrace VW T5 T6 Explorer Sahara Matt Black Alloy Wheels","wolfrace,explorer,sahara,","Sleek and lightweight alloy wheels compatible with VW T5 T6 campervans.

The CB522-LT manipulates both the voltage and current supplied to the battery in an intricate charging profile, which maximises the energy transfer. This charger makes the most of the fast charging capabilities of lithium batteries.</p> <h2>Four-phase charging system</h2> <p>CBE's research into lithium battery chemistry has allowed them to refine their charging profile, which can be simplified into four main phases. It begins with the bulk phase, where high current is used until end-of charge voltage is reached. The absorption phase follows to complete the charge at a lower current without damaging the battery. The battery is then maintained with the float phase, which returns to bulk if loads on the battery cause the voltage to drop below 12.7v. The final refresh phase provides high-voltage charging for a short period to maintain the battery.</p>",229.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.1000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,Y,"Fast delivery options available!","by product",0,0,"Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Electrical;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Electrical/Chargers & Inverters;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Electrical/Chargers & Inverters/Mains Chargers",15096,f/337/CBE_CB522-LT__35652.jpg,"CBE CB522-LT lithium battery charger",Y,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"321622,CB522,CB522-LT","CBE CB522-LT Electronic Battery Charger","321622,CB522-LT,CB522",,,,,New,N,N,,N,,,0,"Default Tax Class",,N,/caravan-motorhome/electrical/cbe-cb522-lt-lithium-12v-battery-mains-230v-charger-works-with-pc100-pc110-pc180-pc200-pc210/,,,321622,,"""Input voltage=230V ~ ± 10%"";""Frequency=50 - 60 Hz"";""Maximum power=320 W"";""Protection fuse ref.

It's tailor made to provide a bespoke fit to the Mercedes Vito V-Class vans from 2015 onwards.</p> <h2>Lightweight design</h2> <p>Ideal for short trips away, this Reimo tailgate tent is quick to pitch and lightweight to carry. Tailgate tents use your vehicle's boot to provide rooftop rigidity, ensuring you get a tall and supported awning every time you pitch.

This gives the tent an excellent hydrostatic head of 3000mm, allowing it to withstand the British weather. The seams are sealed to prevent water seepage, and a UV and fire resistant coating has also been added to prevent damage in the heat.</p> <h3>Reimo Tailgate Tent for Mercedes Vito Features:</h3> <ul> <li>Lightweight 4.4kg design</li> <li>Rapid pitching time</li> <li>PVC window</li> <li>100% ripstop polyester</li> <li>Waterproof PU coating</li> <li>UV and fire resistant coating</li> <li>3000mm hydrostatic head</li> </ul>",174.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.1000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,Y,"Fast delivery options available!","by product",7,6,"Awnings ;Awnings /Campervan/Tailgate tents;Awnings /Campervan",15330,t/829/936283_1__66329.jpg,"Reimo rear tailgate tent for mercedes vito campervans",N,0,15329,k/610/936283_1__22310.jpg,,N,1,17746,a/668/936283__48773.jpg,,Y,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"936283, reimo, update, tailgate tent, tailgate awning","Reimo Update Tailgate Tent for Mercedes Vito V-Class Micro Camper Vans","936283, reimo, update, awning, tailgate, rear, boot, tent","Lightweight and quick-to-pitch tailgate awning for the Mercedes Vito.

This may appear as a broken/deformed pole, or the collapse of the tent and subsequent return to shape when the wind drops.

Product,3452,"Victron Lithium SuperPack 100Ah Leisure Battery",P,BAT512110712,,"Victron Energy",,Right,"<h1>Victron Energy SuperPack 100Ah Lithium Leisure Battery for Campervans, Caravans, Motorhomes &amp; Boats</h1> <h2>12V Off-Grid Power Battery</h2> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The<em> Victron Energy Lithium SuperPack 12.8v LiFePO4 Leisure Battery 100Ah</em>&nbsp;provides a complete, simple lithium battery solution for your off-grid motorhome or campervan. The SuperPack has an integrated BMS (Battery Management System) that offers protection from over discharge, over charge, and low or high temperatures and with an internal switch will disconnect the battery from charge if necessary. This makes the Victron Lithium SuperPack battery easy and simple to install.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Why use a Lithium-Iron-Phosphate battery over lead-acid?</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Also known as LiFePO4 or LFP, Victron Lithium batteries operate well, even if the charge level is not at 100%. In fact, service life will slightly improve in case of partial instead of full charge, a significant advantage over lead-acid leisure batteries. For added safety, SuperPack batteries will cut-off the charge or discharge current when maximum ratings are met.&nbsp;</p> <h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Efficient Power</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">When comparing Li-ion to lead-acid batteries, energy efficiency is a key factor to many installations. Victron LiFePO4 Leisure Batteries can provide round-trip <span>energy efficiency&nbsp;</span>(the act of full discharge from 100% to 0% and back to full charge again) of 92% compared to 80% with lead-acid batteries. Lead-acid batteries can become significantly inefficient when the state of charge is 80% or less. This inefficiency can be particularly noticeable in solar charged systems when several days of reserve energy are required.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Weight Comparison</h3> <p>When comparing similar Amp-Hour rated batteries, Lithium can make substantial weight savings compared to lead-acid. Victron 12v 60Ah Deep Cycle AGM weighs 20kg whereas the equivalent 12.8v Lithium SuperPack 60Ah tips the scales at 9.5kg.&nbsp;</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>Please Note: SuperPack batteries can be connected together in parallel but must not be connected in series</strong>.</span></p>",539.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,51.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,Y,"In stock & sent on a next working day carrier!",none,0,0,"Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Electrical;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome;Caravan, Campervan & Motorhome/Electrical/Leisure Batteries",24956,y/503/Lithium_SuperPack_12.8V_100Ah_1280Wh_front__01532.png,"Victron Energy 100Ah Leisure Battery Lithium SuperPack for caravan, campervan, marine, motorhome",Y,0,24957,f/961/Lithium_SuperPack_12.8V_100Ah_1280Wh_front-angle__24861.png,"SuperPack Lithium Leisure Battery 100Ah ideal for off-grid DC electrical systems",N,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Victron, LFP, Lithium, BAT512060705, BAT512110710, BAT512120705, superpack, BAT512110712","Victron Lithium SuperPack 100Ah Leisure Battery","DC System, Electrical System, 12v, Off Grid, Caravan, Campervan, Motorhome, Marine, Leisure, Battery, Victron, Energy, LiFePO4, Lithium, Super Pack, BMS, BAT512110712","Compact and powerful 12V LiFePO4 100ah leisure battery with built-in BMS.

Inside the bedroom are storage pockets, ideal for stowing torches and mobile phones.&nbsp;The pre-attached front canopy provides additional space for dining or relaxing, ensuring you make the most of those longer sunny days while also providing shelter on rainy days.&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0; text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0; text-align: left;"">The Harris tent uses Sentinal fabric and light-weight fibreglass poles, reducing the pack size and weight&nbsp;in comparison to the air equivalent, meaning much more space in the boot of your car for camping essentials. All this while ensuring Vango's quality and durability.</p> <p style=""margin: 0; text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0; text-align: left;"">This great value tent is available as a bundle with compatible footprint/groundsheet and universal carpet for a complete camping setup.</p> <p style=""margin: 0;
