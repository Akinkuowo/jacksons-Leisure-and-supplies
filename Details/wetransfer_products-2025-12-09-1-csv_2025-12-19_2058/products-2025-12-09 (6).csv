Unlike many other drive-away awnings, the Blossburg 380 Air features an innovative design which can run parallel to your campervan - with the awning's front door alongside the vehicle bonnet, minimising your footprint. The Outwell Easy Pegging System, as well as the efficient manual pump included with the awning, mean you can inflate your Blossburg 380 Air Awning quickly with ease. If that wasn't enough, you can even remove the connection section of fabric - or Link Access Zone - and use it as a stand-alone tent.</p> <h3><span style=""font-size: small;"">Outwell Blossburg 380 Air Features</span></h3> <ul> <li>Tinted windows with toggle-up curtains</li> <li>Elasticated edging fitting tight to your vehicle</li> <li>7mm / 5mm double bead</li> <li>Front protected by Rain Safe canopy</li> <li>Double zips allow full front opening, backed by full mesh panel for insect-free ventilation options</li> </ul> <h3><span style=""font-size: small;"">Outwell Drive Away Awning Specifications</span></h3> <ul> <li>Weight: 20.7 Kg</li> <li>Width: 300 Cm</li> <li>Height: 210 Cm</li> <li>Depth: 515 Cm</li> <li>Attachment Height: 175 - 200 Cm</li> <li>Bead Thickness: 7mm / 5mm</li> </ul> <h3><span style=""font-size: small;"">Outwell Optional Accessories:</span></h3> <ul> <li>Flat woven carpet</li> <li>Footprint</li> <li>Awning Fixing Kit</li> <li>Inner bedroom tent</li> </ul> <p>If you are planning on touring/moving around then we recommend an Outwell drive away fixing kit</p>",599.00,0.00,899.95,599.00,0.0000,N,"The Outwell Blossburg Air 380 awning features a two-year limited warranty, as well as access to Outwell's dedicated after-sales support staff for help and advice.",0.1000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,Y,"Outwell Blossburg Air 380  Awning is sent next working day delivery.","by product",9,0,"Awnings ;Awnings /Campervan;Awnings /Campervan/Drive Away Awnings;Awnings /Campervan/Inflatable Awnings;Sale",11823,x/190/blossburg-380-air__51808.jpg,"Outwell  Blossburg  Air Drive-Away Awning",Y,0,11824,b/711/blossburg-front__14502.jpg,"Outwell Blossburg Air 380 Drive-Away awning front profile",N,1,11825,h/401/blossburg-dimensions__71002.jpg,"Outwell Blossburg Air 380 dimensions specification",N,2,11884,m/466/blossburg-dimensions__01985.jpg,,N,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Drive away, Awning, Campervan, Outwell, Blossburg, inflatable, air, 111089","Outwell Blossburg 380 Air Inflatable Drive Away Campervan Awning","Outwell, Blossburg, Air, Inflatable, Drive-Away, Awning, campervan, ","The innovative Blossburg Air 380 Drive Away Awning by Outwell is a free standing, quick pitch awning designed for campervans.

With the addition of a Truma iNet system you can conveniently control the Combi from your mobile phone using Bluetooth via an app. Additionally, if you have a Truma air-conditioning unit installed, the control panel can automatically co-ordinate the heater and air conditioning unit to ensure your living space maintains a comfortable and controlled environment.</p> <p>The Truma 2E, 4E and 6E feature&nbsp;an integrated 10 litre stainless steel water tank. Suitable for all seasons, it&nbsp;allows for independent heating of hot water in summer mode as well as both hot water and warm air in winter mode.&nbsp;Able to operate on either 230V electric mains voltage or on LPG, the Combi provides hot water, and a warm campervan, motorhome, or caravan, whether on a camping site, or in the wild.
